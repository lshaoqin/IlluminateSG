Project submission for Hack for Good 2023

## Inspiration

Our project started from a point of empathy - as a person with disability, the landscape of life is transformed radically. For someone in a wheelchair, for example, previously familiar paths are rendered inaccessible. One may also feel self-conscious and alone when performing ordinarily mundane tasks in daily life, such as boarding a bus. 

Something that might help with this would be mentoring and friendship from a more experienced PWD. A mentor who is already familiar with the neighbourhood can show their mentee around the neighbourhood, sharing paths, experiences, and tips on how they have navigated life day-to-day. We also believe it greatly valuable for PWDs to form friendships or communities between each other, such that they have someone who shares similar experiences that they can connect and relate to.

## What it does

Our project aims to provide a platform through which new or struggling PWDs can find more experienced PWDs as a friend and guide. PWDs can submit their requests either to look for a mentor, or to be a mentor themselves on our site. Their requests will then be displayed on a map powered by the Google Maps Platform, and can be filtered by disability, distance, and special requests to fit their needs. If a user finds a request which is suitable, they can send an inquiry to the poster, upon which the poster will be notified by email.
